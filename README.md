# SnowCalc
A stupidly simple open source calculator based on the KISS principle.

It is likely that you have a question: "why do I need a calculator that I can make myself in 15 minutes?"
Right question, you don't need those 70 lines of code.
I just wanted to post my creation.

Well, to run your calc you need to compile it. Why didn't I compile it beforehand?
Because I'm on Linux, and it compiles the library specifically for Linux.
